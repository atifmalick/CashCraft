# Simple_ATM-Machine-EMU8086

This project was developed by a freshman student utilizing assembly language.

Title and Introduction

Title: Console-based ATM System Implementation in Assembly Language

Introduction: The purpose of this project is to develop an emu8086-based ATM 

(Automated Teller Machine) using assembly language. Account holders can 
perform a variety of banking tasks using the program's user interface, including 
checking their account balance, withdrawing money, depositing money, changing 
their password, and logging out.
Objectives: The main objectives of the project are as follows:
1. To simulate the functionality of an ATM machine using assembly language.
2. To implement secure login authentication through an account number and 
password.
3. To provide a user-friendly interface for account holders to perform banking 
operations.
4. To maintain account balance.

Methodology

Assembly language is used in the development of the ATM system, enabling direct 
hardware control and effective resource management. The x86 architecture's 
specialized assembly language instructions are used, allowing for low-level 
programming and optimization. This decision guarantees accurate system 
component manipulation and effective ATM functioning implementation. The x86 
architecture was chosen for this project since it is often used in personal 
computers. The x86 architecture and assembly language may be used to create an 
effective and efficient ATM system.

Implementation

The x86 architecture's instructions and registers are utilized in the assembly 
language implementation of the ATM system. The various features are
implemented using a variety of programming techniques, such as loops, 
conditional branching, and stack manipulation. Efficiency, error management, and 
user-friendly interaction are the main goals of the implementation.

Verification and Testing

A thorough testing process is used to guarantee the accuracy and durability of the 
ATM system. Different test cases are created to address various situations, such as 
valid and incorrect inputs, border cases, and concurrent transactions. The 
programmed is thoroughly examined, and any bugs or other problems are quickly 
fixed. 

Conclusion

The ATM machine project implemented in assembly language using emu8086 
provides a user-friendly interface for account holder to perform banking 
operations securely. The project successfully achieves its objectives of simulating 
an ATM machine, implementing login authentication, and enabling various 
banking functionalities such as checking balance, withdrawing money, depositing 
money, and changing the account password. The project can be further enhanced 
by adding additional features like account statements, transaction history, and 
error handling mechanisms.
